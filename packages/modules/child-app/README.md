# ChildApp

Module for child app

## Installation

First, install `@tramvai/module-child-app`

```bash
yarn add @tramvai/module-child-app
```

And then add module to your app

```tsx
import { createApp } from '@tramvai/core';
import { ChildAppModule } from '@tramvai/module-child-app';

createApp({
  name: 'tincoin',
  modules: [ChildAppModule],
});
```

## Explanation

### Terms

- `root-app` - basic tramvai-app constructed with `createApp` from `@tramvai/core`. It can connect with many child-app
- `child-app` - external microfrontend constructed with `createChildApp` from `@tramvai/child-app-core`. It is loaded by root-app and provides some external functionality
- `SingletonDI` - DI-container which is exist in single instance for app and exists as long as app itself
- `RequestDI` - DI-Container which is created for every request and represents specific data for single client. RequestDI inherits providers from SingletonDI and it is independent from other RequestDIs
- `CommandLineRunner` - instance of [CommandModule](references/modules/common.md#commandmodule)

### DI

Every child-app has its own DI-hierarchy which is isolated from other child app and partially from root-app. The only way communicate fpr DIs it's getting providers from root-app di inside child-app.

Next picture shows connection between DI-containers in `root-app` and `child-app`s

![di](/img/child-app/di.drawio.svg)

How does it work when we trying to get provider from DI in `child-app`:

1. First check that provider is exist in the current DI-container. If it is then return it.
2. If current DI is `RequestDI` then go to `SingletonDI` of `child-app` and look for provider.
   1. If it exists in `SingletonDI` then return it
   2. Go to `RequestDI` of `root-app` and if provider exists in it return it
   3. Go to `SingletonDI` of `root-app` and if provider exists in it return it
   4. Throw error otherwise
3. If current DI is `SingletonDI` then go to `SingletonDI` of `root-app` and check for provider there
   1. If it exists then return it
   2. Throw error otherwise

### CommandLineRunner

Each `child-app` has its own CommandLineRunner instance which allows to `child-app` make some preparations before the actual page render. This CommandLineRunner has almost identical lines as `root-app` to simplicity, but it is actually completely other line which are independent from lines in `root-app`

![command-line-runner](/img/child-app/command-line-runner.drawio.svg)

All of the accepted line tokens:

```ts
const command = {
  customer: [
    commandLineListTokens.customerStart,
    commandLineListTokens.resolveUserDeps,
    commandLineListTokens.resolvePageDeps,
  ],
  clear: [commandLineListTokens.clear],
  spa: [
    commandLineListTokens.resolveUserDeps,
    commandLineListTokens.resolvePageDeps,
    commandLineListTokens.spaTransition,
  ],
};
```

Child-app must be preloaded first to allow to execute commandline runner. In case of late preloading CommandLineRunner will be executed anyway but it will be out of sync with root-app CommandLineRunner (it will be called as soon as child-app code was loaded).

#### Server

- If child-app was preloaded before root-app `resolvePageDeps` then `customer` line list is executed on root-app `resolvePageDeps` line
- If child-app was preloaded on root-app `resolvePageDeps` then `customer` line list is executed as soon as child-app was loaded. `preload` call must be awaited in order to prevent root-app CommandLineRunner to passing to next line. That still counts as executing on `resolvePageDeps` line.
- Child-app `clear` line list is executed on root-app `clear` line for every child-app that was preloaded on previous lines

#### Client

##### First Page load

- If child-app was preloaded on server `customer` line list is executed on root-app `resolvePageDeps` line
- If child-app was not preloaded on server but was preloaded on client then `customer` line list is executed on root-app `clear` line
- Child-app `clear` line list is executed on root-app `clear` line for every child-app that was preloaded on previous lines

##### Spa-transitions

- If child-app was not preloaded on any previous pages before but was preloaded on next page then `customer` line list is executed as soon as child-app is loaded
- If child-app was preloaded on next page then child-app `spa` line list is executed on root-app `spaTransition` line

### Loading Child App

Loading of child-app is happens only after preloading child-app with `CHILD_APP_PRELOAD_MANAGER`. This preloading loads code for a child-app and marks it to execution using [CommandLineRunner](#commandlinerunner).

![loading](/img/child-app/loading.drawio.svg)

#### Server

- Calling `PreloadManager.preload(...)` loads a child-app code, executes and marks it as executable to CommandLineRunner
- Result of `PreloadManager.preload(...)` must be awaited as it is important to synchronize child-app commands lines execution with a root-app `CommandLinerRunner`
- Preloads after root-app `resolvePageDeps` are useless as they wont change page render and wont be used by root-app.

#### Client

- Calling `PreloadManager.preload(...)` loads a child-app code, executes and marks it as executable to CommandLineRunner
- Result of `PreloadManager.preload(...)` must be awaited as it is important to synchronize child-app commands lines execution with a root-app `CommandLinerRunner`
- If child-app was preloaded on server then child-app `customer` line list is executed on `resolvePageDeps` on first page render
- If child-app was not preloaded on server then actual loading and command-line execution are happens on root-app `clear` line as executing child-app before page render may break React hydration and should be executed only after it.
- On spa transition when previously child-app is preloaded it will be reused
- On spa transition if preloaded child-app was not loaded before it will be loaded and executed as soon as possible.

### State

State Management is almost completely isolated from root-app and other of child-apps. Every child-app can register own stores, actions.

State for child-apps will be dehydrated on server as separate variable in the result html and then will be automatically rehydrated on client for every child-app.

:::warning

By default, child-app cannot read data from root-app stores, but the you can specify the set of root-app stores that might be used inside child-app.

It may be done using `CHILD_APP_INTERNAL_ROOT_STATE_ALLOWED_STORE_TOKEN` token.

This token is considered undesirable to use as it leads to high coupling with stores from root-app and this way stores in root-app might not change their public interface. But, in most cases, changes in stores ignore breaking change tracking and may breaks backward-compatibility. So **do not use this token if you can**, and if you should - use as little as possible from root-app and provide some fallback in case of wrong data.

[See how to do it](#child_app_internal_root_state_allowed_store_token)

## API

### CHILD_APP_INTERNAL_ROOT_STATE_ALLOWED_STORE_TOKEN

Defines the list of allowed root-app store names that might be used inside child-app.

1. Specify stores that might be used inside child-app

   ```ts
   provide({
     provide: CHILD_APP_INTERNAL_ROOT_STATE_ALLOWED_STORE_TOKEN,
     multi: true,
     useValue: [MediaStore, AuthenticateStore],
   });
   ```

2. Use the specified root-app stores the same way as usual stores

   ```ts
   import React from 'react';
   import { useSelector } from '@tramvai/state';

   export const StateCmp = () => {
     const value = useSelector(['root'], (state) => {
       return state.root.value;
     });

     return <div id="child-state">Current Value from Root Store: {value}</div>;
   };
   ```

## How to

### Connect a child app

1. Place a child-app React component somewhere in your page render

   ```ts
   import React from 'react';
   import { ChildApp } from '@tramvai/module-child-app';

   export const Page = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         ...
         <ChildApp name="[name]" />
         ...
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

1. Add configuration for child-app loading

   ```ts
   providers: [
     provide({
       provide: CHILD_APP_RESOLVE_BASE_URL_TOKEN, // or use `CHILD_APP_EXTERNAL_URL` env
       useValue: 'http://localhost:4040/',
     }),
     provide({
       provide: CHILD_APP_RESOLUTION_CONFIGS_TOKEN,
       useValue: [
         {
           name: '[name]', // name of the child-app
           byTag: {
             latest: {
               version: '[version]', // current version for the child app for tag `latest`
             },
           },
         },
       ],
     }),
   ];
   ```

1. Preload child-app execution in order to improve performance and allow child-app execute its data preparations

   ```ts
   import { commandLineListTokens, Provider, provide } from '@tramvai/core';
   import { CHILD_APP_PRELOAD_MANAGER_TOKEN } from '@tramvai/module-child-app';

   const providers: Provider[] = [
     provide({
       provide: commandLineListTokens.customerStart,
       multi: true,
       useFactory: ({ preloadManager }) => {
         return function preloadHeaderChildApp() {
           return preloadManager.preload({ name: '[name]' }); // this call is important
         };
       },
       deps: {
         preloadManager: CHILD_APP_PRELOAD_MANAGER_TOKEN,
       },
     }),
   ];
   ```

### Preload child-app

Preloading is vital for using child-app without extensive overhead on its loading.

You may preload using next ways:

1. Preload with `CHILD_APP_PRELOAD_MANAGER_TOKEN`

   ```ts
   provide({
     provide: commandLineListTokens.customerStart,
     multi: true,
     useFactory: ({ preloadManager }) => {
       return function preloadHeaderChildApp() {
         return preloadManager.preload({ name: '[name]' });
       };
     },
     deps: {
       preloadManager: CHILD_APP_PRELOAD_MANAGER_TOKEN,
     },
   });
   ```

1. Add needed child-apps to the pageComponent or layoutComponent through field `childApps`

```ts
import { PageComponent } from '@tramvai/react';

const PageCmp: PageComponent = () => {
  return 'Page';
};

PageCmp.childApps = [{ name: '[name]' }];
```

### Debug child-app

#### Single child-app

1. Run child-app using cli

   ```sh
   yarn tramvai start child-app
   ```

2. Run root-app with `CHILD_APP_DEBUG` environment variable

   ```sh
   CHILD_APP_DEBUG=child-app yarn tramvai start root-app
   ```

#### Multiple child-app

1. Run somehow multiple child-apps. They should be started on different ports.
2. And either pass `Base Url` showed from cli as url to debug every child-app

   ```sh
   CHILD_APP_DEBUG=child-app1=baseUrl1;child-app2=baseUrl2 yarn tramvai start root-app
   ```

3. Or implement proxy on default `http:://localhost:4040/` yourself which redirects to concrete server by url

   ```sh
   CHILD_APP_DEBUG=child-app1;child-app2 yarn tramvai start root-app
   ```

#### More detailed debug setup

You may specify a full config to debug to a specific child-app:

1. To token `CHILD_APP_RESOLUTION_CONFIGS_TOKEN` for needed child-apps add special tag `debug`:
   ```ts
   ({
     name: 'child-app',
     byTag: {
       latest: {
         version: 'latest',
       },
       debug: {
         baseUrl: '...url',
         version: '...version',
         client: {},
         server: {},
         css: {},
       },
     },
   });
   ```
2. Run root-app with `CHILD_APP_DEBUG` environment variable with value of child-app names needed to debug

## Known issues

### This Suspense boundary received an update before it finished hydrating

When `React` >= `18` version is used, child-app will be wrapped in `Suspense` boundary for [Selective Hydration](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/130).
This optimization can significantly decrease Total Blocking Time metric of the page.

There is one drawback of this optimization - if you will try rerender child-app during selective hydration, `React` will switch to deopt mode and made full client-rendering of the child-app component.
Potential ways to fix this problem [described here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24476#issuecomment-1127800350).
`ChildApp` component already wrapped in `React.memo`.

Few advices to avoid this problem:
- Memoize object, passed to child-app `props` property
- Prevent pass to child-app properties, which can be changed during hydration, for example at cliend-side in page actions
